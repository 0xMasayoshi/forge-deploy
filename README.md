# forge-deploy

A cli and associated contracts to keep track of deployments by name and reuse them in solidity.

It tries to keep compatibility with [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) as far as possible (work in progress).

Features
- generate type-safe deployment function for forge contracts. no need to pass in string of text and hope the abi encoded args are in the correct order.
- save deployments in json file (based on hardhat-deploy schema)
